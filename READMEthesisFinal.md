This folder contains all files to run the simulations

Simulation_linear runs the Linear boundary search

Simulation_piecewise runs the Piecewise boundary search

Simulation_linear_crowd runs the Linear boundary search with a flashcrowd

Simulation_piecewise_crowd runs the Piecewise boundary search with a flashcrowd

FBS_Boundary_search_lin is Algorithm 1 in the report, which finds the most optimal linear boundary(Implemented Simulations 1,3)

FBS_Boundary_search_pw is Algorithm 2 in the report, which finds the most optimal piecewise boundary  using input that is output from FBS_Boundary_search_lin (Implemented Simulations 2,4)

FBS_Boundary_search is Algorithm 3 in the report, which combines 1,2 to find the most optimal piecewise boundary with only the input to FBS_Boundary_search_lin

For all simulations, run more than once to see bar plot results. Please save the functions: tspsearch, FBS_Boundary_search_lin and FBS_Boundary_search_pw to run the programs.

Follow the comment instructions next to the plot in the FBS_Boundary_search algorithms to see all plots at all instances
